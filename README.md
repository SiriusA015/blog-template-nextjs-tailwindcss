## Motivation
We wanted to create and start a blog with as little investment as possible and the criteria was that it should be fast, static, easy to work on and no backend or server required, so we started working on a blog for ourself and in the middle we thought of making it in such a way that it is easy for others also including non techies to just simply download the code and start their own blog.

We wanted to make it as feature rich as medium or dev.to, so we took some design ideas and inspirations from them and tried to make a template which suits our need and might help others too.

In this template we have used Next.js SSG to create static HTML files which can be hosted on firebase or any static site hosting service. There is also options like vercel for hosting Next.js dynamic webistes but we wanted this template to be easy to use for any non techie person too, so we explored the option of static site generation.
